**Do this silently:**

1. Read the instructions in files in folder `modules/module-07-delivery/` and .agent/rules/instructions-for-scripts.md
2. Follow the script precisely and guide the student through creating a delivery plan in `artifacts/delivery_plan.md`.
3. Follow the teaching script precisely as instructed:
   - Deliver no-prefix text naturally to students
   - Stop at "STOP:" points and wait
   - Execute "ACTION:" blocks as specified
   - Start teaching immediately (no meta-commentary)
4. Help them create Jira tickets using the `atlassian-mcp-server`.
