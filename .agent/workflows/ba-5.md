**Do this silently:**

1. Read the instructions in files in folder `modules/module-05-feature-design/` and .agent/rules/instructions-for-scripts.md

3. Follow the teaching script precisely as instructed:
   - Deliver no-prefix text naturally to students
   - Stop at "STOP:" points and wait
   - Execute "ACTION:" blocks as specified
   - Start teaching immediately (no meta-commentary)
4. Help them write user stories in `artifacts/user_stories.md`.
