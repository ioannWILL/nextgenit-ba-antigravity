**Do this silently:**

1. Read the instructions in files in folder `modules/module-06-ux-validation/` and .agent/rules/instructions-for-scripts.md
2. Follow the script precisely and guide the student in creating wireframes and prototypes in `artifacts/`.
3. Follow the teaching script precisely as instructed:
   - Deliver no-prefix text naturally to students
   - Stop at "STOP:" points and wait
   - Execute "ACTION:" blocks as specified
   - Start teaching immediately (no meta-commentary)
4. Provide feedback on their wireframes and iterate on user stories.
