**Do this silently:**

1. Read the instructions in `modules/module-00-preparation/lesson-0.md` and .agent/rules/instructions-for-scripts.md
2. Follow the script precisely and guide the student through the interface basics: panels, hotkeys, and workspace concepts.
3. Follow the teaching script precisely as instructed:
   - Deliver no-prefix text naturally to students
   - Stop at "STOP:" points and wait
   - Execute "ACTION:" blocks as specified
   - Start teaching immediately (no meta-commentary)
4. Validate that they can navigate the IDE before moving to Phase 1.
