# Lesson 5.1: Feature Decomposition

## Context
"Governed AI" is too big. We need to break it down into smaller, Shippable components for the engineering team. This is "Epics to Stories" work.

## Your Task
Decompose the "Governed AI" product into 3 major sub-features (e.g., Auth & Identity, PII Filter Service, Usage Dashboard).

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Decomposition**: "Decompose the 'Audit Logging' requirement into 4 technical sub-tasks for an engineer."
2.  **Structuring**: "Group these sub-tasks into a clear hierarchy in `artifacts/feature_breakdown.md`."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/feature_breakdown.md` with a hierarchy of Epics and Tasks.

**STOP:** Move to Lesson 5.2.
