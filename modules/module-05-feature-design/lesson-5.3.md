# Lesson 5.3: Data & Integration Analysis

## Context
The "Governed AI" system needs to talk to Jira and store Audit logs. You need to define *what* data is moving between these systems.

## Your Task
Define the data schema for an "Audit Log Entry" and map the integration flow between our system and Jira.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Schema Drafting**: "Design a JSON schema for an Audit Log entry that includes UserID, PromptHash (for privacy), Category, and Timestamp."
2.  **Flow Diagrams**: "Describe the integration flow when a user 'Converts a Prompt Response to a Jira Ticket'. What fields are sent to the Jira API?"

## Deliverables
Create `artifacts/data_model.md` and `artifacts/integration_flows.md`.

**STOP:** Verify the student has created `artifacts/data_model.md` and `artifacts/integration_flows.md` before proceeding.
