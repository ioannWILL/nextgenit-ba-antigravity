# Lesson 5.2: User Stories & ACs (Gherkin)

## Context
Developers need precision. "The system should be secure" is not a requirement. "Given a user is not an admin, when they try to access logs, then they see a 403 error" is.

## Your Task
Write 5 User Stories with detailed Acceptance Criteria (AC) using the Gherkin format (Given/When/Then).

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Story Writing**: "Write a User Story for the 'PII Filtering' feature. Use the format: *As a [role], I want [action], so that [value].*"
2.  **AC Generation**: "Generate 3 'Unhappy Path' Gherkin scenarios for the login flow."

## Deliverables
Create `artifacts/user_stories.md`.
Create an `artifacts/login_flow.feature` file with your Gherkin scenarios.

**STOP:** Move to Lesson 5.3.
