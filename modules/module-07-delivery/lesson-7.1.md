# Lesson 7.1: Delivery Plan

## Context
Features don't ship all at once. You need a rollout strategy. Phase 1: Internal alpha. Phase 2: Beta for Frontend team. Phase 3: Enterprise release.

## Your Task
Create a Delivery Plan identifying dependencies and the "Release Train" for the MVP.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Dependency Mapping**: "In my `artifacts/feature_breakdown.md`, which tasks must be finished before the 'PII Filter' can be tested? Generate a dependency list."
2.  **Plan Drafting**: "Draft a 1-page `artifacts/delivery_plan.md` that outlines the Jan 15 milestone."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/delivery_plan.md`.

**STOP:** After creating the artifact, ask: "Delivery plan is ready. Open `artifacts/delivery_plan.md` and review the phased rollout and dependencies. Does this timeline align with the Jan 15 milestone mentioned in the exec summary? Ready for Jira integration in Lesson 7.2?"
