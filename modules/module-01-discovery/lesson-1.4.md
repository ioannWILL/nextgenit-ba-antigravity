# Lesson 1.4: Discovery Backlog

## Context
Usually, BAs rush to write requirements. A *senior* BA knows that more discovery is needed when information is contradictory. You need to identify what we *don't* know yet.

## Your Task
Create a backlog of "Discovery Tasks" (spikes, research items, follow-up meetings) required to reduce the project's ambiguity.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Unknown Identification**: "Based on the security interview, what technical unknowns remain regarding 'PII scrubbing'?"
2.  **Jira Integration (Simulation)**: "Write a prompt for Antigravity to create 3 Jira 'Discovery' tickets based on the holes in our current documentation."

## Deliverables
Create a file named `artifacts/discovery_backlog.md` with a list of tasks, their rationale, and the stakeholder needed for each.

Propose user to create JIRA issues based on the file in real JIRA.
