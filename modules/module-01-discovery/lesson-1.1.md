# Lesson 1.1: Interview Synthesis

## Context
You have just joined the "Governed AI" project. The team has been using a prototype script called "Clawd Bot," but it's a mess of security risks and technical debt. Before we define requirements, we need to understand what our stakeholders actually *need* versus what they *say*.

## Your Task
Analyze the interview notes in `discovery-results/interviews/` and extract the core needs, pain points, and hidden assumptions.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Multi-file Analysis**: "Analyze all files in the interviews folder and summarize the conflicting needs between Security and the Frontend team."
2.  **Pattern Detection**: "What is the common technical complaint across all engineering interviews?"

## Deliverables
Create a file named `artifacts/stakeholder_needs.md` in this directory with the following structure:
- **Stakeholder Group**
- **Core Needs**
- **Pain Points**
- **Priority (High/Med/Low)**

And a file `artifacts/assumptions_risks.md` listing at least 3 risks identified during discovery.

---
**STOP:** Once you have created these files, move to Lesson 1.2.
