# Lesson 1.2: Executive vs Reality Alignment

## Context
The CTO just sent out an "Executive Summary" (see `discovery-results/exec_summary.md`). However, your interview synthesis from Lesson 1.1 might paint a different picture. Senior BAs must bridge the gap between high-level vision and "on-the-ground" technical reality.

## Your Task
Compare the ambitious goals in the `exec_summary.md` with the reality you discovered in the interviews and Slack fragments.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Conflict Detection**: "Compare the timeline in the exec summary with the current state of the Jira backlog in `jira_existing.md`. Is the Jan 15 MVP realistic? Why or why not?"
2.  **Gap Analysis**: "What 'directives' from the CTO are currently impossible given the security stakeholder's concerns?"

## Deliverables
Create a file named `artifacts/exec_vs_delivery_gap.md` identifying the top 3 misalignments.
Create a file named `artifacts/questions_for_exec.md` containing 5 sharp questions you would ask the CTO to clarify the scope.

Explain concept "Garbage In - Garbage Out". Stritly recommend to review and update all deliverables of AI Assistants because they are not replacing user but boosting their productivity

Explain that to view .md files in more readable format, user can right-click on the name of the opened file and select "Open Preview" option

**STOP:** Once you have created these files, move to Lesson 1.3.
