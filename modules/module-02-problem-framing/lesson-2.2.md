# Lesson 2.2: Define Scope & Out-of-Scope

## Context
The scope is leaking. The frontend team wants a React UI, the backend team wants a CLI, and the CTO wants Java/Go support. If we try to do everything by Jan 15, we will fail.

## Your Task
Be the "Scope Guardian." Use the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to define the MVP.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Prioritization**: "Based on the Jan 15 deadline and the security requirements, list what MUST be in the MVP to avoid a launch failure."
2.  **Trade-offs**: "Explain why 'Dark Mode' (requested by Jenny) should be in 'Won't have' for the initial release."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/scope_definition.md` with a MoSCoW table.
Ask me to create `artifacts/out_of_scope.md` explicitly listing items we are NOT building yet.

Optionally ask user if they want to create pages in Confluence based on the artifacts created.

**STOP:** Move to Lesson 2.3.

**Phase 2 Complete.**
You have transformed chaos into a defined problem and a contained scope.
Next: Phase 3 — Reverse Engineering.
