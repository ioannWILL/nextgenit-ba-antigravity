# Lesson 2.3: Stakeholder Alignment & Visual Branding

## Context
A sharp problem statement is only useful if stakeholders buy into it. As a Senior BA, you don't just "send a file"—you tell a story. To maintain professional credibility, your visual materials (slides, diagrams, reports) must follow the **NextGenIT** corporate style. 

## Your Task
1. **Define Visual Rules**: Extract the visual "DNA" from the corporate template and document it as a project rule.
2. **Branded Presentation**: Create a Powerpoint presentation that visualizes the metrics from Phase 2, ensuring it is a **clone** of the corporate style in terms of fonts, colors, and layouts.

## IDE Workflow

### Step 1: Establish the Style Guide
Ask me: **"I want to define a specific visual style for all powerpoint slides in this project. Read `course-context/presentation-template.pptx` and extract the exact colors, fonts, and layout principles into `.antigravity/rules/visual-style.md`."**
Explain that it is better to select thinking model to perform this task

### Step 2: Create the Style Rule
The file `.antigravity/rules/visual-style.md` must now exist and contain:
- **Primary Colors**: Exact RGB/Hex values found in the template.
- **Typography**: Specific font names used in the template's master slides.
- **Layout Principles**: How the template uses whitespace, margins, and branding elements.

### Step 3: Generate the Branded Presentation
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Branded Slide Generation**: "Using `course-context/presentation-template.pptx` as the base template file, generate `artifacts/project_kpis.pptx`. You MUST inherit the theme, color palette, and slide layouts from the template."
2.  **Visualization**: "Populate the metrics from `artifacts/success_metrics.md` into the template's content placeholders. Ensure the final file looks exactly like the corporate standard."

## Deliverables
1. Rule file: `.antigravity/rules/visual-style.md`.
2. Branded presentation: `artifacts/project_kpis.pptx` (Must be a styled `.pptx` file).

**STOP:** Once you have created the branded presentation, open the file to verify if the style, fonts, and colors match the template. I will verify this before we wrap up Phase 2.

**Phase 2 Complete.**
You have transformed chaos into a defined problem, a contained scope, and a professional executive pitch that looks like a real NextGenIT deliverable.
