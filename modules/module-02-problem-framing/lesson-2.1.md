# Lesson 2.1: Define the Real Problem

## Context
Everyone is asking for "features" (dark mode, VS Code plugin, etc.). But what problem are we *actually* solving for the business? Is it productivity? Is it security? Is it cost control?

## Your Task
Synthesize all Phase 1 artifacts into a formal Problem Statement and define how we will measure success.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Drafting**: "Write a 1-sentence problem statement for the 'SuperCoder' project that addresses the CTO's vision AND the Security team's concerns."
2.  **Metric Design**: "Help me define 3 'North Star' metrics for this project. How do we measure 'productivity' for 500 engineers?"

## Deliverables
Create `artifacts/problem_statement.md` containing:
- The Problem (The "Pain")
- The Impact (Why it matters now)
- The Vision (The "Future State")

Create `artifacts/success_metrics.md` listing 3-5 KPIs.

Ask user if they want to create pages in Confluence based on the artifacts created.
