# Lesson 6.2: Interactive Prototype

## Context
Validating flows with stakeholders is easier when they can click things. You'll build a very simple interactive prototype (mocked logic) inside the IDE.

## Your Task
Use Antigravity to build a small web-app prototype that "simulates" a prompt being sent and checked by a PII filter.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Prototype Building**: "Build a single-file HTML/JS app where I can type a prompt. If the prompt contains an email, show a 'Security Warning' before simulating the AI response."
2.  **Validation**: "Open the prototype in a browser (if available) or review the code to ensure it meets the 'RBAC' requirements from Phase 4."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/local_prototype.html`.

**STOP:** Move to Lesson 6.3.
