# Lesson 6.1: Wireframes from Requirements

## Context
A BA often acts as a bridge to Design. You need to show the layout of the "Governed AI" dashboard, specifically the security toggles and the quota indicator.

## Your Task
Create a textual wireframe mock-up (using Markdown tables or ASCII) or an HTML snippet that represents the main user interface.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **UI Layout**: "Generate an HTML/Tailwind mockup of a 'Developer AI Dashboard' with a sidebar for settings and a main chat area."
2.  **Permission-Based UI**: "Modify the mockup to show what a 'Viewer-only' user would see vs an 'Admin' (e.g., hide the Admin settings)."

## Deliverables
Create `artifacts/wireframes.md` and an `artifacts/preview.html` file.
