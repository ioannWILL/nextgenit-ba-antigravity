# Lesson 6.3: UX Review & Iteration

## Context
Usually, once a BA sees the prototype, they realize some requirements were wrong. "Actually, users should be able to override the PII filter if it's a false positive."

## Your Task
Conduct a "Self-Review" of your requirements based on the prototype. Identify 3 friction points.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Iterative Thinking**: "Based on the prototype from Lesson 6.2, identify 2 potential UX frustrations for a developer who is in a rush."
2.  **Requirement Update**: "Update the `artifacts/user_stories.md` from Phase 5 to include an 'Override' flow with an audit log."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/ux_feedback.md`.
Ask me to update `artifacts/user_stories.md`.

**STOP:** Verify the student has created `artifacts/ux_feedback.md` and updated `artifacts/user_stories.md` before proceeding.
