# Lesson 6.3: UX Review & Iteration

## Context
Usually, once a BA sees the prototype, they realize some requirements were wrong. "Actually, users should be able to override the PII filter if it's a false positive."

## Your Task
Conduct a "Self-Review" of your requirements based on the prototype. Identify 3 friction points.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Iterative Thinking**: "Based on the prototype from Lesson 6.2, identify 2 potential UX frustrations for a developer who is in a rush."
2.  **Requirement Update**: "Update the `artifacts/user_stories.md` from Phase 5 to include an 'Override' flow with an audit log."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/ux_feedback.md`.
Ask me to update `artifacts/user_stories.md`.

**STOP:** After creating/updating the artifacts, ask: "UX feedback captured and user stories updated. Review `artifacts/ux_feedback.md` — do these friction points match what you observed testing the prototype? Check the updated `artifacts/user_stories.md` for the new override flow."

**STOP:** Once confirmed, ask: "Phase 6 is complete. You now have validated wireframes, an interactive prototype, and refined user stories based on UX feedback. Ready to move to Phase 7 — Delivery & Atlassian Integration? Type `/ba-7` when you're set."

---
**Phase 6 Complete.**
You have a validated design.
Next: Phase 7 — Delivery & Atlassian Integration.

When you're ready to start Phase 7, type:
```
/ba-7
```
