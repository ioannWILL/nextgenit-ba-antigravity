# Lesson 8.2: Executive Readout

## Context
The project is ready for launch. Now you need to explain to the CTO (who wrote the original `exec_summary.md`) how we addressed their vision while navigating the messy reality of security and technical debt.

## Your Task
Produce an Executive-ready "Readout" or presentation outline.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Summarization**: "Summarize the entire project (from Discovery to UAT) into 5 bullet points for a CEO."
2.  **Narrative Building**: "Write a short memo to the CTO explaining how we solved the 'Shared API Key nightmare' while still hitting the Jan 15 deadline."
3.  **Full-Project Review**: "Analyze all artifacts in `artifacts/` and generate a 'lessons learned' document — what went well, what assumptions changed, and what risks materialized during the analysis."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/exec_readout.md`.
Ask me to create `artifacts/lessons_learned.md` (retrospective across all phases).

**STOP:** After creating the artifacts, ask: "Executive readout and lessons learned are complete. Review `artifacts/exec_readout.md` — would this satisfy the CTO's original vision from the exec summary? Check `artifacts/lessons_learned.md` for insights across all phases."

**STOP:** Once confirmed, ask: "The course is complete. You've navigated a complex, senior-level BA project — from messy discovery notes to governed delivery. Your `artifacts/` folder contains a complete BA delivery package. In a real engagement, these would be your handoff to the development team and evidence trail for the steering committee. Well done."

**Course Completed.**
You have navigated a complex, senior-level BA project using AI as your thinking partner. You moved from messy reality to governed delivery — analyzing a real codebase, synthesizing contradictory stakeholder input, and producing enterprise-grade artifacts.

The artifacts in your `artifacts/` folder represent a complete BA delivery package. In a real engagement, these would be your handoff to the development team and your evidence trail for the steering committee.
