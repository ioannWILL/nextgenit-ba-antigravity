# Lesson 8.1: UAT & Acceptance

## Context
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final gate. Does the software do what the BA said it should do?

## Your Task
Create a UAT Plan and an Acceptance Checklist to verify that the engineers built the "PII scrubbing" and "RBAC" correctly.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Test Case Generation**: "Generate 5 UAT test cases based on the `artifacts/business_rules.md` and `artifacts/user_stories.md`. Include Expected Results."
2.  **Checklist Drafting**: "Create a simple 'Acceptance Checklist' for the Product Owner to sign off on."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/uat_plan.md` and `artifacts/acceptance_checklist.md`.

**STOP:** Move to Lesson 8.2.
