# Lesson 4.1: Stakeholder-Driven Requirements

## Context
It's time to write the requirements for the "Enterprise AI Platform" (the replacement for Clawd Bot). You must distinguish between Functional (what it does) and Non-Functional (how it behaves).

## Your Task
Generate a comprehensive set of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Requirement Generation**: "Based on Phase 1-3, write 10 functional requirements for the 'Governed AI' platform. Focus on Security, User Auth, and Integration."
2.  **NFR Drafting**: "Draft NFRs for Latency (how fast is the bot?), Availability, and Data Residency."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/functional_requirements.md`.
Ask me to create `artifacts/nfr.md`.

**STOP:** Move to Lesson 4.2.
