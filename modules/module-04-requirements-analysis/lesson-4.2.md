# Lesson 4.2: Business Rules & Governance

## Context
AI is expensive and dangerous without rules. How do we ensure "Contractors" don't see "Core" code? How do we stop the "AI bill" from exploding?

## Your Task
Define the Business Rules and the Roles & Permissions Matrix.

## IDE Workflow
Use Antigravity to:
1.  **Rule Definition**: "Write 5 business rules for 'Token Usage Quotas'. How should the system handle a user who hits their daily limit?"
2.  **RBAC Matrix**: "Create a markdown table for Roles (Dev, Lead, Security, Admin) vs Permissions (Ask, Read Logs, Delete History, Config)."

## Deliverables
Ask me to create `artifacts/business_rules.md`.
Ask me to create `artifacts/roles_permissions_matrix.md`.

**STOP:** After creating the artifacts, ask: "The business rules and RBAC matrix are ready. Check `artifacts/business_rules.md` and `artifacts/roles_permissions_matrix.md`. Does the permission model match what Alex (CISO) outlined? Ready for the risk analysis in Lesson 4.3?"
