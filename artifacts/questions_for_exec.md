# Critical Questions for the CTO

1. **Scalability & Architecture**: How do we reconcile the Jan 15 deadline with the fact that we lack a basic REST API and a production-grade hosting environment (currently running on local laptops)?
2. **Security Compliance**: Given that the CISO office has declared PII scrubbing a non-negotiable blocker, how much of the initial budget is allocated to building custom governance filters versus LLM tokens?
3. **Internal vs. External Tools**: If productivity is the primary goal, have we performed a formal CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis) of building this internally versus purchasing Enterprise licenses for tools like Copilot, specifically regarding maintenance of technical debt?
4. **Scope Prioritization**: Success for Platform Engineering looks like "documentation search," while for Devs it looks like "code generation." Which of these defines the MVP's success?
5. **Cost Allocation**: How will we manage the unmonitored $4,000+ monthly OpenAI spend across 500+ engineers without the implementation of per-user quotas and cost-tracking tags?
