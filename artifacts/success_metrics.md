# Success Metrics: Governed AI Platform

To verify the impact of the Governed AI platform, we will track the following North Star metrics and KPIs:

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Developer Velocity** | 30-40% reduction in lead time | Measures the actual productivity boost promised by the CTO. |
| **Security Compliance** | 95% auto-detection of PII; MTTR < 1h | Measures risk reduction and response speed instead of absolute zero. |
| **Operational Governance** | 100% of spend traceable | Eliminates the "$4,000 unmonitored bill" problem via per-user/team quotas. |
| **Adoption Rate** | 80% active users by March | Measures the tool's utility and the success of the rollout to all 500+ engineers. |
| **Data Quality** | <5% hallucination report rate | Measures how well the AI understands internal "Knowledge Management" vs. legacy code. |

## Verification Method
- **Quarterly Survey**: "How much time is the AI saving you daily?"
- **Audit Log Scan**: Automated weekly checks for PII filter bypass attempts.
- **Billing Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of token spend by cost center tags.
