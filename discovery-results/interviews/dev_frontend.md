# Interview Notes: Frontend Lead (Jenny)
Date: 2025-10-14

**Context**: Frontend team wants AI to help with React components and accessibility checks.

**Key Points**:
- "The current CLI tool is useless for us. We live in VS Code or the browser."
- Wants a Chrome extension or VS Code plugin. "If I have to switch to a terminal to ask for CSS, I've lost flow."
- **Complaint**: The backend team's script assumes Python environment. frontend devs hate setting up the venv just to run the bot.
- **Feature Request**: "Can it generate the storybook stories automatically?"
- **Constraint**: "We can't send customer PII to the AI. We need a filter that scrubs emails/phones before sending the prompt."

**Quote**: "I saw a prototype of a web interface for Clawd. It looked okay, but it didn't have dark mode. Unusable."

**Mentioned Risks**:
- "Last week, a junior dev pasted a production JWT into ChatGPT. We need to prevent that."
