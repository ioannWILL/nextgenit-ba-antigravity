# Executive Summary: Project "SuperCoder" (Internal AI)

**Date**: Oct 1, 2025
**From**: CTO & VP of Engineering
**To**: All Engineering

**Vision**:
By Q1 2026, every engineer at NextGen IT will have an intelligent AI pair programmer ("Clawd") that increases productivity by 40%. This tool will be fully integrated into our workflow, secure by design, and serve as the foundation for our AI-first culture.

**Strategic Goals**:
1.  **Accelerate Velocity**: Reduce boiler-plate coding time.
2.  **Knowledge Management**: The AI serves as a "living documentation" of our legacy codebase.
3.  **Modernization**: Use the AI to help migrate our monolith to microservices.

**Directives**:
- The tool must be available to all 500+ engineers.
- It must support all our languages (Java, Python, JS, Go).
- Security is paramount—no IP leakage.

**Budget**:
- Initial CapEx approved. OpEx (token costs) needs to be monitored but investment is prioritized.

**Timeline**:
- POC (Proof of Concept): Done (The "Clawd" script).
- MVP Launch: Jan 15, 2026.
- Full Rollout: March 2026.

**Ask**:
We need a dedicated team to productize the POC. It's currently just a script, but we need an Enterprise Application.
